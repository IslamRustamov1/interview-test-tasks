# Interview test tasks base

Here is where we will share interesting and challenging tasks we encountered during interviews (or anywhere else).

# Contributing

1. Create a new branch from `main`
2. In new branch, upload a directory *<task_name>* with two files: `index.js` (including solution of the task), `README.md` (including description of the task)
3. Create a merge request and assign it to the owner of the repo

# Naming conventions

Branch name format:

`task/<name-of-the-task>` (for new tasks)

`fix/<name-of-the-task>` (to fix errors in existing tasks)

`refactor/<name-of-the-task>` (to improve existing tasks)
